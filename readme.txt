Easily display your 3D-models. Upload to media gallery, add shortcode - ready!

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to show your 3D models easily in your wordpress blog.

Simply upload the model and all files references (eg. textures) to the wordpress media gallery, 
add a shortcode to the page where the model should be shown and there you go. 

Currently, Collada DAE and OBJ and OBJ/MTL files are supported.
Please file a request for other required file formats.

The 3D stage is highly configurable: Define background, ambient or directional light 
as well as the cameras and your models position and scale.

For a good application example, [look here](http://openbuilds.com.mx/tienda_de_openbuilds_mexico/guia-lineal-v-slot/#) (thanks to Ronald van Arkel):

Add the shortcode [3D], wherever you want your model to appear.

* model: name of the model file in the media gallery or full URL. Mandatory. Use *.objmtl if you want OBJ/MTL and name the MTL file exaclty as the OBJMTL file.

* background: Background color. Optional, default is "ffffff".
* opacity: Background opacity. Optional, default is 1.
* ambient: Color of ambient light. Optional, default is "404040".
* directional: Direction and color of directional light source. Optional, default is "1,1,1:ffffff"
* model-position: Point of origin of the model. Optional, default is "0,0,0".
* model-scale: Scale of the model. Optional, default is "1,1,1".
* class: CSS class of div around canvas. Optional, no default.
* style: CSS style of div around canvas. Optional, no default.
